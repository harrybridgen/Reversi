# Reversi (Othello)
By Harry Bridgen

## Overview

This is a Java implementation of the board game Reversi (Othello), developed as part of university coursework.

The base project was provided by the University of Nottingham. I extended and modified it to include additional features and improve structure and maintainability.

## Provided Code

The following components were supplied by the university:
- Initial game logic
- Basic JavaFX UI skeleton
- Core structure of the `Board`, `Tile`, and `Player` classes

## My Contributions

- Refactored and cleaned up existing code for clarity
- Improved UI and event handling
- Added score display and turn indicator
- Enhanced move validation and user feedback
- Made the project more modular and maintainable
