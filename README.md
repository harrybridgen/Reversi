# Reversi (Othello)
By Harry Bridgen

## Overview

This is a Java implementation of the board game Reversi (Othello), developed as part of university coursework.

The base project was provided by the University of Nottingham. I extended and modified it to include additional features and improve structure and maintainability.

## Provided Code

The following components were supplied by the university:
- Initial game logic
- Basic JavaFX UI skeleton
- Core structure of the `Board`, `Tile`, and `Player` classes

## My Contributions

- Refactored and cleaned up existing code for clarity
- Improved UI and event handling
- Added score display and turn indicator
- Enhanced move validation and user feedback
- Made the project more modular and maintainable

## How to Run

1. Open the project in IntelliJ or any Java IDE.
2. Ensure Java 17+ and JavaFX are set up (SDK required).
3. Run the `Main` class.

## Requirements

- Java 17+
- JavaFX SDK
- IntelliJ IDEA
